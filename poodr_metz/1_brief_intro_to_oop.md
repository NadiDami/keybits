## A Brief Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming

* Object-oriented (OO) applications have two components: objects and the messages they send to one another
  * Objects have *behaviour* and can also contain *data*
  * Objects invoke the behaviour of other objects by sending them messages

* Ruby is a class-based OO language.
  * A class acts as a *blueprint* for objects of the same type to be constructed
  * Methods on the class define behaviour
  * Variables define attributes
  * Methods are invoked when messages are sent
  
#### Keybit:
  
  "The `String` class...*is itself an object*; it's an instance of the `Class` class. Just as every string object is a data-specific instance of the `String` class, every class object is a data-specific instance of the `Class` class. The `String` class manufactures new strings, the `Class` class manufactures new classes."
