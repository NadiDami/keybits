### Primary Practices

The following are a list of practices that enable you to start moving towards applying XP to your work environment. When thinking about where to start, think about which practice will be your biggest opportunity for improvement.

* Sit Together
  * Create an open space big enough for your whole team
  * If necessary, only introduce this gradually, to minimise resistance and resentment from those who treasure their private space

* Whole Team
  * Make sure your team includes people with all the skills and perspectives necessary for the project to succeed
  * Minimise context switching wherever you can
  * Cultivate a sense of 'belongingness'

* Informative Workspace
  * An observer should be able to walk into the team space and get a general idea of how the project is going

 * Energized Work
  * Only work for as long as you can be productive
  *  "Software development is a game of insight, and insight comes to the prepared, rested, relaxed mind."

 * Pair Programming
  * A dialogue between two people simultaneously programming
  * By pairing you can clarify ideas and come to solutions more quickly
  * Be sure to respect your pair's personal space

 * Stories
  * Write stories around the framework of customer-visible functionality

* Weekly Cycle
  * Plan work a week at a time
  * Have a meeting at the beginning of the week where you review progress to date and have your client prioritise a week's worth of stories
  * The 'weekly heartbeat' gives you a platform for team and individual experiments, e.g. for the next week we'll switch pairs every hour

* Slack
  * Always leave room for tasks to be dropped if you get behind
  * You can also structure slack, e.g. hack days

* Ten-Minute Builds
  * Automatically build the whole system and run all of the tests in ten minutes

* Continuous Integration
  * Integrate and test changes after no more than a couple of hours

* Test-First Programming
  * Write a failing automated test before changing any code
  * Writing tests first help to keep scope creep in check
  * If a test is hard to write, it could be a signal of a design problem where you have highly coupled code
  * Testing first can help you find a coding rhythm, e.g. test, code, refactor...

* Incremental Design
  * Make the design of the system an excellent fit for the needs of the system that day
