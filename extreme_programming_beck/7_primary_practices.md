### Primary Practices

The following are a list of practices that enable you to start moving towards applying XP to your work environment. When thinking about where to start, think about which practice will be your biggest opportunity for improvement.

* Sit Together
  * Create an open space big enough for your whole team
  * If necessary, only introduce this gradually, to minimise resistance and resentment from those who treasure their private space

* Whole Team
  * Make sure your team includes people with all the skills and perspectives necessary for the project to succeed
  * Minimise context switching wherever you can
  * Cultivate a sense of 'belongingness'
