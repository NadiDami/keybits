### Applying XP

XP takes place in a complex social context. Just applying the techniques doesn't give you control of the organisation or your project. Applying XP and seeing dramatic results takes a matter of years, rather than weeks. You will see improvements in the first weeks or months, but this only sets the stage for the big leaps forward later on.

#### Keybit:
"Starting with XP is more like getting into a pool than adopting a child. There are many ways to get into a pool...There is not one right way to get in the water."

Make sure you lead by example. Expecting others to do what you are not willing to try yourself is disrespectful and ineffective. A misalignment of authority and responsibility creates distrust.

Change yourself and then offer the fruits of that change to others.

You may try a new practice and performance falls. It doesn't mean that the new practice is bad. It may just mean that you don't have enough experience for it, or there were prerequisites needed that weren't in place. Change back to your old practice and address the underlying issues.

The course of improvement is not smooth or predictable. It can be slow and tortuous, but not always. Conditions that facilitate sudden turnarounds are:

* *Aligned vaues* The team and organisation and willing to accept and work with the XP values.
* *Pain* The team has been through a recent loss like layoffs or a failed deployment. Clear memory of recent pain makes people more willing to try dramatic changes.

##### Choosing a Coach

A 'coach' is someone who provides a balance between being part of the team and having an independent perspective. The coach spots opportunities for improvements and leads the experiments addressing them. They are not enmeshed in the day-to-day group dynamics.

You can apply XP successfully without an experienced coach. Applying XP does not happen without leadership though, whether this comes from inside or outside the team.

The values, principles, and practices of XP are best learned by example. You can learn from someone who has made all of the mistakes or you can make the mistakes yourself. A coach can accelerate your learning.

Selecting a coach is an important and challenging decision. They should be aligned enough with your existing values to be effective, but firm enough in the XP values to keep leading the team in that direction. They should have enough technical skill to teach what people can't easily learn on their own. Most importantly, they should encourage independence, not dependence. A good coach moves on a little before you think you're ready and leaves a team that is firmly on its way to sustainable, profitable, stable, fast, fun software development.

##### When You Shouldn't Use XP

XP is ineffective in organisations whose actual values are at odds with the XP values. Trying to espouse XP values here will cause trouble rather than create improvement.
