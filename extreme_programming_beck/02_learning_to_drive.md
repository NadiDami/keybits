### Learning to Drive

The paradigm of XP can be summarised as follows: Stay aware. Adapt. Change.

In software, everything is always changing, whether that be the technology, the team members, the requirements.

#### Keybit:

"The problem isn't change, because change is going to happen; the problem, rather, is our inability to cope with change."
