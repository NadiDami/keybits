### Offshore Development

Considering a multi-site team comes down to a business decision: Is the waste created by not sitting together more than offset by other advantages?

A multi-site team(MST) has to embrace feedback more tightly because of isolation arising out of distance. Communication has to be nurtured more.

"You'll have to work harder to achieve simplicity because you won't have as many chances for serendipitous discovery of excess complexity."

Respecting everyone is even more important given differing cultures and lifestyles.

Some of the practices may have to be modified for MSTs:

* Planing may have to occur more frequently than weekly
* Don't abandon practices just because they seem difficult
* The single code base is even more important
