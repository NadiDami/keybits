How does one get started with XP?

Starting with any of the primary practices are safe. It's hard to jump in and do all of the practices and embrace all of the values. Whilst change doesn't have to be slow, changing too quickly means you risk slipping back into old habits. New habits take time to solidify and in the meantime constant review is invaluable.

You can use XP-style planning to determine what to change first. Write stories about how you can improve your software development process, estimate how long each will take, and figure out a budget for process improvement. Choose one story to work on first. Adapt where necessary.

"Defects should be notable because they are rare. Major scope adjustments because of lack of progress should only need to occur in the first half of the schedules. Initial deployment of software should come after a small percentage of the project budget is spent. Teams should be able to grow and shrink without catastrophic consequences. XP is a way to get to that place."
