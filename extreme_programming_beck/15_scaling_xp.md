### Scaling XP

In this chapter, we take a look at all of the dimensions along which software development can scale:

* Number of people
  * Where you think you need a large team, perhaps the problem could indeed be solved by a small team
  * Turn big programming problems into smaller problems that can be solved by small teams
  * Integrate frequently to help coordination between teams
  * The aim is to limit coordination costs so you should split the work in a way that allows for autonomous teams

* Investment
  * How does accounting handle software development?
  * Find a ally in the finance department to help navigate issues that may arise

* Size of Organisation
  * How do you implement XP in a wider organisation that isn't changing?
  * Maintain communication with other sectors but do not impose any changes
  * It can be useful to have a skilled project manager that provides an interface between the XP team and the rest of the organisation. They make sure the organisation's expectations are met

* Time
  * The simplest case of scaling in time is if the team maintains continuity throughout the project
  * Documentation and tests help in cases where continuity is not possible

* Problem Complexity
  * XP is suited to projects requiring the close cooperation of specialists
  * It is important that team members are patient in the beginning as they work together while learning about each others' specialities

* Solution Complexity
  * Chip away at complexity while continuing to deliver

* Consequences of Failure
  * How do you use XP in a safety- or security-critical project?
  * Auditing should happen early and often
  * Traceability is built into XP. This is the ability to link what has changed in a system to why it changed.
