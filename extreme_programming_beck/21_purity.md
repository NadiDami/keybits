### Purity

"Is my team extreme?"

If you're expecting a binary or numerical answer to this question, then asking it makes no sense.

XP makes certain predictions about what will lead to good results. The values, principles, and practices are there to provide guidance. Don't just stop writing documentation and use XP as an excuse. This example highlights a team that shows contempt for communication, rather than embracing it as a value.

"It's worse to fail with an XP team than to succeed with a pure waterfall team. The goal is successful and satisfying relationships and projects, not membership in the XP Club."

When you say your team is extreme, you set other people's expectations for your style of communication, development practices, and the speed and quality of your results.
