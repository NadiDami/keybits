### Values

XP espouses five values

* Communication
* Simplicity
* Feedback
* Courage
* Respect

#### Communication

When your team encounters a problem think about whether it was caused by a lack of communication. How can your team now communicate in order to solve the problem and ensure that the same issue doesn't arise?

Communication helps your team to bond and is a key component to effective cooperation.

#### Simplicity

"What is the simplest thing that could possibly work?"

Bias your thinking toward eliminating unnecessary complexity. 

#### Feedback

Feedback can come in a range of forms:

* What is your opinion on a suggested idea?
* How does the code look once you've implemented said idea?
* Were the tests easy to write?
* Do the tests run correctly?
* Does the idea work now that it has been implemented?

Shorten the feedback cycle as best as you can. The more quickly you know, the more quickly you can adapt.

It is possible to have too much feedback, so slow down feedback cycles to a level where you're getting some regularly enough but can still respond to it and develop new functionality.

#### Courage

Effective action in the face of fear.

Courage may manifest itself in a bias to action. It may manifest itself in the patience to wait for a problem to reveal itself when you feel one approaching. The courage to be honest fosters communication and trust. Courage to change a course of action can lend itself to finding simpler solutions.

#### Respect

Respect underpins the four previous values. The contributions of each person on a team has to be respected. Without respect and care amongst a team, XP cannot work.

### Summary

The five values above are the driving values of XP, but not the only possibly values. Whatever your team values are, the key is to align team behaviour to those values in order to minimise waste.
