### Values

* Communication

#### Communication

When your team encounters a problem think about whether it was caused by a lack of communication. How can your team now communicate in order to solve the problem and ensure that the same issue doesn't arise?

Communication helps your team to bond and is a key component to effective cooperation.

#### Simplicity

"What is the simplest thing that could possibly work?"

Bias your thinking toward eliminating unnecessary complexity.
