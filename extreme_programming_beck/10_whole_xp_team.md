### The Whole XP Team

This chapter contains guidelines for each role to be played in an XP team.

* Testers
  * They help customers write automated system-level tests in advance of implementation
  * They coach programmers on testing techniques
  * Testers amplify communication by looking at 'happy paths' and asking about scenarios where things go wrong
  * Implementation uncovers new details that need to be specified and testers work on the automated tests for those

* Interaction Designers
  * They write stories and evaluate usage of the current system in order to find new opportunities for functionality
  * The tools of interaction design include personas and goals
  * They work with customers in order to clarify stories

* Architects
  * They look for and execute large-scale refactorings
  * They write system-level tests that stress the architecture

* Project Managers
  * Facilitate communication inside the team and coordinate communication with customers, suppliers, etc.
  * Plans need to be kept in sync with reality

* Product Managers
  * They write stories and prioritise them
  * They are there to answer questions as implementation uncovers unspecified areas of the stories
  * Stories are sequenced according to business value

#### Keybit:
"If you plan to process images, you should be able to process an image at the end of the first week. The product manager picks stories to make this happen."

* Executives
  * They provide an XP team with courage, confidence, and accountability
  * They can also monitor and facilitate improvement
  * There should be frequent and open communication such that executives already have the information to make decisions when the time arises

* Technical Writers
  * They provide early feedback about features and create closer relationships with users
  * If users don't look at a certain type of documentation, stop writing it

* Users
  * They are most valuable if they have knowledge and experience with systems similar to the one being built
  * It's also useful if they have a good relationships with a large potential user community

* Programmers
  * They estimate stories, break stories into tasks, write tests and code, automate development, and gradually improve the design of the system

* Human Resources
  * Two main challenges for XP: reviews and hiring
  * Evaluating team members individually can still be possible in XP. Do they:
    * act respectfully?
    * play well with others?
    * take initiative?
    * deliver on their commitments?
  * An options is to move to team-based incentives and raises
  * With respect to hiring, you would rather opt for the competent-but-social programmer rather than an extremely skilled loner
  * The best interviewing technique is to have the candidate work with the team for a day; pair programming is a good test of technical and social skills

* Roles
  * Roles on a mature XP team are not fixed
  * Everyone should be able to contribute the best they have to offer
  * As the team matures, there has to be an alignment of authority and responsibility: anyone can recommend changes, but this should be backed up by action
