### Testing: Early, Often, and Automated

"Without trust, people spend much of their time defending themselves against the possibility that someone else may have made a mistake."

We have a dilemma in software development where defects are expensive, but eliminating software defects is also expensive. Still, most defects end up costing more than they would have cost to prevent them in the first place. XP aims to prevent defects from arising in the first place.

There will always be defects. The key is to learn from them so there are no repeats.

XP has two principles that will increase the cost-effectiveness of testing:

1. Double-checking

    * We specify what we want a computation to do by writing a test. Then we implement the computation. This is a form of double-checking. If both of the expressions of computation match up, then the code and tests are more likely to be correct.

2. Defect Cost Increase

  * The sooner you find a defect, the cheaper it is to fix it.

Automated testing helps to shorten the feedback loop such that defects can be fixed sooner.

Tests provide a measure of confidence and a measure of progress.

#### Keybit:

"Running tests give the team a valid basis for confidence as it moves quickly in unanticipated directions."
