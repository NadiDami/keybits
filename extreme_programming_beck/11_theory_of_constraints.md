### The Theory Of Constraints

"The Theory of Constraints says that in any system there is one constraint at a time."

To improve throughput in a system you need to first identify the constraint then think about how you can increase its capacity, offload some of the work to non-constraints, or eliminate the constraint altogether.

How do I identify a constraint? Work piles up in front of one.

However, given the theory, when you eliminate one constraint you create another. This should tell us to avoid micro-optimization and look at the whole situation before starting to make changes.

The Theory of Constraints is a good tool to use to become more aware of your process, however it is important to remember that software development involves human beings.

#### Keybit:
When applying XP it's very important to have executive support within your organisation. Once you have an XP software development team functioning smoothly, constraints will be shifted to other areas of the organisation. If those areas cannot handle this, XP will be seen as the root of the problem.

"If you don't have executive sponsorship, be prepared to do a better job yourself without recognition or protection."
