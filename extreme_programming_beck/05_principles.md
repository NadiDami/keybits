### Principles

Values are too abstract to directly guide behaviour.

What are the principles behind XP?

#### Humanity

Software development and the environment it occurs in should meet human needs, acknowledge human fallibility, and leverage human strength.

#### Economics

Make sure that everything you do has business value and serves business needs.

Think about the 'time value of money' and the 'option value of systems and teams'.

What you're building is more valuable the more it earns money sooner and spends money later.

How flexible is your software for being used beyond its originally intended purpose.

It's important to balance enhancing the option value of the software and the team whilst not wasting money investing in speculative flexibility.

#### Mutual Benefit

Every activity should benefit all concerned.

This is the most important XP principle and the most difficult to adhere to.

#### Self-Similarity

Try copying the structure of one solution into a new context, even at different scales.

#### Improvement

Aim for excellence in software development through improvement.

#### Diversity

In order to best solve problems and implement solutions, teams need to bring together a variety of skills, attitudes, and perspectives.

#### Reflection

_How_ is your team working and _why_ are they doing what they are doing?

Why did you suceed? Why did you fail?

Expose mistakes and learn from them.

#### Flow

Flow is delivering a steady flow of valuable software by engaging in all activities of development simultaneously.

#### Opportunity

View problems as opportunities to learn, improve, and change.

#### Redundancy

Keep redundancy where it serves a valid purpose, that is, uncovering defects. You may have many practices that catch the same defects, but the defect problem in general cannot be solved with a single practice.

#### Failure

Failure is never a waste if it imparts knowledge. When you don't know what approach to take, risking failure can be the shortest route to success.

#### Quality

Sacrificing quality is not an effective means of control. Aiming for higher quality often results in faster delivery; lowering quality standards results in less predictably delivery later on.

#### Baby Steps

"What's the least you could do that is recognizably in the right direction?"

Teams can take many small steps so rapidly that they appear to be flying ahead.

As a team, you want to avoid 'wastefully [recoiling] from aborted big changes'.

#### Accepted Responsibility

"Responsibility cannot be assigned; it can only be accepted."

### Conclusion

Use the principles to understand practices better. Principles give you a better idea of what a practice is intended to accomplish. When you understand the principles, you have the opportunity to create practices that work in harmony with your existing practices and your overall goals.
