### Planning: Managing Scope

"The state of a shared plan provides clues about the state of the relationship between the people affected by the plan."

When we plan in XP, we start with the current goals, assumptions, and facts. Given this, you can decide what's in scope and what is out of scope.

Planning also involves deciding what to do next out of all of the possibilities. Plans are not predictions of the future. Rather, they provide you with a starting point and help you to coordinate with other teams.

Take these four steps when you plan. It works for every timescale:

1. List the items of work that may need to be done.
1. Estimate the items.
1. Set a budget for the planning cycle.
1. Agree on the work that needs to be done within the budget. It's important that you don't change the estimates or the budget as you negotiate.

Everyone on the team should be involved in planning.

How do you ascertain what the budget (time to completion and team size) is?

Make sure you divide effective programming hours by two to account for pairing. Rather than cut effective programming time into half, pair programming often leads to teams that are more than twice as productive.

Be prepared for the plan not to match reality. When this happens, think about how you can avoid this in the future. If there is no process change that can be done, speak to the customer about which stories they want to see completed first. Then your team should focus on those.

"When things aren't going well is when we most need to adhere to our values and principles and modify our practices to remain as effective as possible."
